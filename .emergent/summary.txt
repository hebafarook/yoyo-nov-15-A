The trajectory documents a rapid, iterative development process heavily driven by large, detailed user specifications. The initial work focused on foundational bug fixes, such as ensuring data persistence by linking assessments to a  and implementing role-based access control.

The project quickly escalated in scope. The first major task was to replace a hardcoded assessment report with a dynamic, LLM-generated one. This involved integrating the  library into the FastAPI backend and building a new React component, , to display the results.

Subsequently, the user requested the creation of three distinct, comprehensive user portals from scratch: a Parent Portal, a Coach Portal, and a complete overhaul of the existing Player Portal. For each, the user provided multi-page specifications detailing data models, UI layouts, and functionality. The AI engineer's approach was to create placeholder React components for all specified pages and then integrate the main dashboard for each role into  using conditional rendering based on the user's role (, , ). The work was paused immediately after creating the new files for the Player Portal, with the next logical step being to integrate it into the main app.

<product_requirements>
The Yo-Yo Elite Soccer Player AI Coach is a comprehensive web application for managing and tracking soccer player development. It serves three user roles: Players, Coaches, and Parents.

The core workflow involves players or coaches inputting performance metrics. The backend uses an LLM to analyze this data and generate a detailed Player Performance Report with visual gauges, trend charts, and tailored recommendations.

The application has been significantly expanded to include dedicated portals for each user role:
- **Parent Portal:** A read-only interface for parents to view their child's progress, training plans, assessment history, and communicate with coaches.
- **Coach Portal:** A full management system for coaches to oversee multiple players, create/assign training plans, review assessments, and manage teams.
- **Player Portal:** An updated, gamified dashboard for players to follow their daily training sessions, track their long-term progress, view assessments, and communicate with their coach.

The system is designed for data isolation, ensuring users can only see data they are authorized to view (e.g., a parent only sees their own child's data).

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, , , , Shadcn UI & Tailwind CSS. State management via  ().
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Motor (async MongoDB driver), Pydantic.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based system supporting 'Player', 'Coach', and 'Parent' roles.
- **AI Integration:**  library used to connect to an LLM for generating dynamic assessment reports.
- **Database:** MongoDB, using UUIDs for identifiers.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo structure with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. The frontend has been recently structured to support role-specific portals.



- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the root component that controls the entire application's UI flow. It manages routing and, most critically, conditionally renders the correct user portal (Player, Parent, or Coach) based on the authenticated user's role.
  - **Summary of changes:** It was heavily modified to implement the portal system. Instead of a single tabbed layout for everyone, it now contains logic like , which directs users to entirely different interfaces after login.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This file contains the API endpoint responsible for using an LLM to generate player performance reports from assessment data.
  - **Summary of changes:** This was updated from a placeholder function to a real LLM integration. It now uses the  library and an API key from the  file to call an external LLM, passing it a structured prompt to generate a JSON report.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main entry point for the Parent Portal. It contains the sidebar navigation and renders the various parent-specific pages.
  - **Summary of changes:** Created from scratch as part of the Parent Portal feature request. A logout button was added later to fix an oversight.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main entry point for the Coach Portal. It structures the complex coach interface with its own sidebar and content area.
  - **Summary of changes:** Created from scratch. Its styling was later updated from a dark, glassmorphism theme to the app's standard light theme to ensure visual consistency. A logout button was also added.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The new, intended entry point for the revamped Player Portal.
  - **Summary of changes:** This file was just created as a placeholder to house the new player experience, including a bottom navigation bar and various new screens. It has not yet been integrated into .

<pending_tasks>
- **Siri Shortcuts Integration:** Mentioned as a potential feature early in the development process but was never prioritized or implemented.
- **Old Data Migration:** A script to associate older, un-linked database records with s was considered but not pursued after the initial data persistence fixes were made.

<current_work>
The most recent task was a complete overhaul of the **Player Portal**. Following a detailed, multi-page specification from the user, the previous engineer was in the process of replacing the original player-facing UI with a more modern, gamified, and mobile-first experience.

The work accomplished so far includes:
1.  **Creation of New Component Files:** A new directory, , was created. Within it, placeholder components for the entire new portal were generated based on the user's spec. This includes:
    *    (the new main container)
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   

The development was paused immediately after these files were created. The new  component has not yet been integrated into the main application's rendering logic in . The last action was acknowledging the user's request to continue and preparing to perform this integration.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the new  component into , making it the primary view for users with the 'player' role, and then begin populating the new player components with UI elements and mock data.
